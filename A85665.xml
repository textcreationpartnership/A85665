            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Our Stating the before≈øaid Ca≈øes, and our Evidencing of what is the Truth therein, by clear Scriptures, and by Grounds deduced thence, we doe ≈øtill fully Adhere unto: How≈øoever ≈øome or other of the Scandals before≈øaid, ≈øome formerly, and ≈øome of late, have ≈ølanderou≈øly laid to our charge.</p>
            <p>And now whereas of late yeares, the wi≈øe Providence of our God hath ≈øo Ordered it, that ≈øuch readine≈ø≈øe and chearfulne≈ø≈øe of many Chri≈øtians, that are Tearmed <hi>Independents,</hi> in their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to the Parliament, even from the beginning of the late warres unto this day: and ≈øuch faithfulne≈ø≈øe and diligence hath been expre≈ø≈øed by many of them, in the State; and in the Armie, as well under the <hi>Earle of E≈ø≈øex,</hi> and the <hi>Lord Fairfax,</hi> as under the Pre≈øent Captaine Generall, the <hi>Lord Cromwell;</hi> that hereby many of them have been judged worthy of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Places of Tru≈øt and Preferment, as well in <hi>England,</hi> as in <hi>Wales</hi> &amp; <hi>Ireland.</hi> And whereas this hath occa≈øioned (though cau≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øly,) the Envy of many again≈øt them: and many have fal≈øly ≈øaid, That they ≈øeek to get all ≈øuch places into their own hands, and to exclude all others from them.

                  <hi>That all People in Every Nation as well Members of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as others, ought for Con≈øcience ≈øake, to Honor ≈øuch, as by the wi≈øe Di≈øpo≈øing Providence of God, are their Pre≈øent Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers; and are to ≈øubmit to the Civill Commands, not onely of ≈øuch Rulers as are faithfull, but even to Infidels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus the Apo≈øtle <hi>Paul</hi> Commands us from the Lord, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1. to 8. <hi>ver≈ø.</hi> (with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.37.) <hi>Let every ≈øoule be ≈øubject to higher Powers.

                  <hi>That all that profe≈ø≈øe them≈øelves Chri≈øtians, or Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ought to endeavour, ≈øo far as their place and power rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:165975:3"/>that all Rulers amongst them, ≈øhould be men truely fearing God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our Ground is, the Expre≈ø≈øe Charge of the Almighty. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.3. <hi>The God of I≈ørael ≈øaid, the Rock of I≈ørael ≈øpake unto me; HE THAT R<g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>LETH OVER MEN, Mu≈øt be J<g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>ST, R<g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>LING IN THE FEAR OF GOD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Suitable thereto, is that in <hi>Exod.</hi> 18.21. <hi>Provide out of all the People, Men of ability</hi> (or <hi>Courage,</hi>) <hi>≈øuch as FEAR GOD; Men of Truth; hating Covetou≈øne≈ø≈øe.</hi> The≈øe ≈øhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd, before all other Qualifications, of Birth, Riches, or Parts; as we will An≈øwer it before the Great <hi>JEHOVAH.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>The feare of the Lord is the Beginning of Wi≈øedome, P≈øal.</hi> 111.10. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.7. The≈øe will Pray, and God will give them Wi≈øedome, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.5, 6. <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.1.-4.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Becau≈øe when men Feare not God, they are more obnoxious and liable to all wickedne≈ø≈øe, Injury, Tyranny, Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.11. <hi>They-≈øeek not after God-Their Throat is an open Sepulcher. Their feet are ≈øwift to ≈øhed bloud-De≈øtruction and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øery are in their wayes, and the way of Peace they have not knowne.</hi> And what's the Root of all this? <hi>There is no feare of God before their Eyes.</hi> Hence when <hi>Abimelech</hi> asked, <hi>What ≈øawe≈øt thou, that thou ha≈øt done this thing? Abraham ≈øaid; Becau≈øe I thought, ≈øurely the feare of God is not in this place; therefore they will ≈ølay me, for my Wives ≈øake,</hi> Gen. 20.10, 11.</p>
               <p>The≈øe <hi>two</hi> being premi≈øed:</p>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. We <hi>Explaine</hi> thus,</p>
               <p>Such Per≈øons doe <hi>Feare the Lord,</hi> that endeavour to keep a <hi>good</hi> Con≈øcience before God, and before men: Such as through grace <hi>Deny ungodline≈ø≈øe and worldly lu≈øts, and live ≈øoberly, righteou≈øly, and godly in this pre≈øent World, Tit.</hi> 2.12. Now among ≈øuch who≈øe Fathers had all been drunk with the Babyloni≈øh Cup, and the dreggs and darkne≈ø≈øes thence, are not quite di≈øpelled from us. And but by Degrees doe we attaine to further know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the My≈øtery of Chri≈øt and of Antichri≈øt) there are no doubt many ≈øuch per≈øons, ≈øo fearing God as is before≈øaid, that have not all attained to the ≈øame degree: and they mu≈øt all be fully per≈øwaded in their owne minds, in what they practi≈øe. Now if meerly for Con≈øcience ≈øake, &amp; for their ≈øo practi≈øing or not daring to practi≈øe, if any ≈øuch ≈øhould therefore be Excluded from being <hi>Cho≈øen,</hi> or from being <hi>Choo≈øers:</hi> or if the <hi>Cho≈øen,</hi> and the <hi>Choo≈øers</hi> ≈øhould be ≈øo limited that all of them ≈øhould be onely of one ≈øort and ≈øize, excluding all the re≈øt; This might be a great wrong, both to <hi>God</hi> and to <hi>Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. We <hi>Confirme</hi> this Propo≈øition thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> This cour≈øe is a <hi>wrong to God,</hi> when <hi>his Children,</hi> whom he loves ≈øo dearly, and who are ≈øo accepted of him, are for his ≈øake ≈øo rejected by men: As in <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 66.5. <hi>Your brethren that ca≈øt you out for my Names ≈øake,</hi> &amp;c. And this is a wrong to Je≈øus Chri≈øt, who is in all his: and will ≈øay to ≈øuch as ≈øo reject them, at the great Day, on this wi≈øe, <hi>In as much as yee did it to the lea≈øt of the≈øe that beleeve in me, you did it to me, Mat.</hi> 25.45, 46.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, Repl.</hi> This Cour≈øe were al≈øo a <hi>wrong to Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, <hi>To the Per≈øons ≈øo rejected,</hi> that upon the like Ground and Principle are liable to be <hi>Per≈øecuted</hi> by them, and worne out, ≈øo as to occa≈øion the Exile of many out of our Nation, as it fared with many of our Brethren here under the Prelacy.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>It were a Wrong,</hi> or Damage, <hi>to the Per≈øons</hi> that <hi>≈øo alone</hi> are fully <hi>Empowered</hi> to <hi>Choo≈øe,</hi> and to be <hi>Cho≈øen:</hi> Whereby they are mo≈øt lyable to ≈øuch a Temptation, as is to be Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again≈øt by Tender Souls, as Wi≈øe <hi>Agur</hi> did again≈øt being Enriched, <hi>Lea≈øt I be full and deny</hi> [or <hi>bely</hi>] <hi>thee, Prov.</hi> 30.9.

               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:165975:4"/>
               <p>Thirdly, Thereby it may be a <hi>Wrong to that City or Nation:</hi> where,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Many being partakers of the Sin, are like to partake al≈øo of the Puni≈øhment due thereunto; even the Sin and Puni≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Antichri≈øtians, Rev.</hi> 18.4. One of their Sins being this, Per≈øecuting of Saints for not <hi>Conforming</hi> to them; rigorou≈øly pre≈ø≈øing to <hi>

               <p n="2">2. Hereby many others are the More hardened again≈øt all Profe≈ø≈øors and Profe≈ø≈øion, when they ≈øee Profe≈ø≈øors ≈øo oppo≈øing Each other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> How little cau≈øe there is for any of the≈øe to ≈øeek the Excluding of the other, may further appeare by the≈øe Con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. All tho≈øe that feare the Lord among≈øt us, are all the Children of one God and Father.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They are the Redeemed of one Lord and Saviour Je≈øus Chri≈øt, who hath loved them, and given him≈øelfe for them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They have the Holy Spirit their Sanctifyer and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They have One Faith, and hope of their Calling, <hi>Ephe≈ø.</hi> 4.4, 5.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They have all of them one and the ≈øame Inheritance, which is immortall, undefiled, uncorruptible, which fadeth not away, which is re≈øerved in Heaven for them, who are kept by the power of God through faith unto Salvation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3, 4.</p>
               <p n="6">6. They have the ≈øame Common Enemies to them all; the Fle≈øh, the Devill, and the World: and in the World not onely <hi>Pagans, Turks,</hi> and <hi>Papi≈øts</hi> abroad, but generally all per≈øons that are in their <hi>Naturall, Carnall,</hi> and <hi>Corrupt</hi> e≈øtate at home.</p>
               <p n="7">7. All the≈øe have al≈øo the very ≈øame Weapons and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, wherein they all generally with one minde agree toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther again≈øt all tho≈øe their Common Enemies, &amp;c. The≈øe have <hi>More with them then are again≈øt them,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The Time is comming, and we hope is neer at hand, when all that feare the Lord ≈øhall be of one minde and of one heart, and ≈øhall wor≈øhip him with one con≈øent. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.9. Then they ≈øhall have ≈øuch externall Vi≈øible Union and Communion that ≈øhall <hi>Convince the World</hi> (that are not convinced by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls) <hi>that the Father hath loved them all, as he hath loved his Son;</hi> as our Lord Je≈øus prayed: and therefore it ≈øhall certainely be
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:165975:5"/>effected, becau≈øe the Father alwayes heard him, <hi>John</hi> 17.21, 23. <hi>John</hi> 11.41. Therefore ≈øhould all the≈øe be far from excluding each other, eyther from being Choo≈øers or from being Cho≈øen unto places of Power or Authority.</p>
               <p>Thus have We with one Con≈øent <hi>Declared</hi> our ≈øelves touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Books afore≈øaid, being ≈øuch as we never con≈øented un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, nor owned: and al≈øo our Grounds and Rea≈øons why Wee are far from approving of them. And the ≈øincerity of our Hearts in what We have Declared herein, We take the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God to Record upon our Souls.</p>
